# Digitalization-and-Value
An eclectic repository for explorations of the connections of digitalization and company value

Hi, I'm Rachel and I'm an independent researcher, former business analyst and now strategy consultant.
My longstanding interests in economics continue to intrude into my research around digital transformations in companies.
More recently, an article in the WSJ inspired me to put my data analysis skills to work. I also wanted a scratch pad to explore and apply alternative analysis tools--not just using SAS but R or maybe Python. 
This is that scratch pad where I'll post related research references as well as data and ideally some analysis.
